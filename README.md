üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get RentNest up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

npm or yarn

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd rentnest

2. Install Dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

3. Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys and connection strings.

# Clerk Authentication Keys (from your Clerk Dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY

# MongoDB Connection (update with your MongoDB Atlas or local connection string)
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

Important:

Ensure there are no spaces around the = signs.

Do not commit your .env.local file to version control. It's already ignored by .gitignore.

4. Database Setup (Drizzle & MongoDB)
Connect to MongoDB: Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible from your DATABASE_URL.

Run Drizzle Migrations (if applicable): If you have Drizzle migrations set up, you might need to run them to sync your schema with the database. Consult your drizzle.config.ts or related files for specific commands (e.g., drizzle-kit push:pg or drizzle-kit generate).

5. Install shadcn/ui Components (if not already present)
If you're getting "Module not found" errors for shadcn/ui components (like switch, textarea, tabs), you need to add them to your project:

npx shadcn@latest add switch
npx shadcn@latest add textarea
npx shadcn@latest add tabs
# ... add any other missing shadcn components as needed

6. Run the Development Server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

7. Build for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:

npm run build
# or
yarn build

This will generate the .next folder with the optimized production build.
